# BBC_movies_project
 We scrapped all the movies mentioned on ['The 21st Centuryâ€™s 100 greatest films: Who voted?'](http://floatingmedia.com/columbia/BBC.html), done by the BBC.

After that, using regex, we scrapped each director biography (IMDB) in order to computationally find out their gender, and with that information, we filtered those movies exclusively shot by female directors.

Finally, we scrapped a 29-page list related to the Bechdel test (our burning question was: do movies shot by women usually pass this test?) and plotted all into a Mapbox Map.

This project was the final exercise for Data and Datasets subject at Columbia University School of Journalism.
