# BBC_movies_project
 We scrapped all the movies mentioned on 'The 21st Centuryâ€™s 100 greatest films: Who voted?', done by the BBC.

After that, using regex, we scrapped each director biography (IMDB) in order to find out their gender and filter those movies exclusively shot by female directors.

Finally, we scrapped a 20-page list related to the Bechdel test (do movies shot by women usually pass this test?) and plotted all this information together into a Mapbox Map.

This project was the final exercise for Data and Datasets subject at Columbia University/School of Journalism.
