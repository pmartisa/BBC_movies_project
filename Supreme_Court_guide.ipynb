    "The ultimate goal of this project is to build a database of Supreme Court cases for 2020 (or a different range of years) that includes the dialogue from the oral arguments of each case. As we have seen in class the arguments were scraped from this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript.aspx \n",
    "\n",
    "See if you can follow that guide to downloading and transforming pdfs to texts (don't be shy on slack!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a folder of texts transcripts there are three primary programmatic steps that you need to complete:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please note:** Step 3 is the most challenging--if you want to spend some time coding, you can skip Steps 1 and 2 and get to work on Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 1:** scrape all of the case information available on this page: https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcript/2020\n",
    "\n",
    "This should include case name, docket number, etc--and most importantly the name of the PDF file. All of the text files share the exact same name as the PDF files they came from. This file name will allow you to connect your transcription data with your case data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is up to you what kind data structure you want to build. But it likely to be a list of lists, or list of dictionaries--for each case you will have a list or dictionary of the information you scrape from the webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 2:** find secondary source(s) to scrape/integrate with your case data. The information on the Supreme Court page is very limited. You need to find a source or group of sources that ad information. The most important information would likely be: the decision, who voted for and against, and the district court origin of the case (for geocoding). You might think of other great things to put in there too! This information needs to be merged with the data you have from STEP 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "**STEP 3:** use regular expressions to clean up and parse the text files so that you have a searchable data structure containing the dialog from the transcripts. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Architecture** \n",
    "You will need to think about how you will set up, separate, and join different tables that you create. The initial scraping will give you very simple dataframe: the columns will be dockett, case name, date argued, and PDF name. The regex work on the PDFs should result in a very simple table (or just a list of tuples) of speaker name and dialogue. \n",
    "\n",
    "`[('MR. BERGERON',\" Yes. That's essentially the same thing\"),('JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR',' So how do you deal with Chambers?')]`\n",
    "\n",
    "But make sure you attach the docket number or pdf filename to each set of arguments you transform using regex. Your secondary sources and information should be linked by docket number, but the question is how to set up those data frames, join them, aggregate them, and narrow them to the fields necessary for presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go step-by-step through this, and DM me on Slack whenever you get stuck, and I will help. If you complete all the steps before Friday, Slack me if you want to go further.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Interpretive Architecture**\n",
    "Also consider what kind of interpretive categories you can add through your reading and research. At the very least, it is recommended that you come up with categories for the kinds of cases that are before the court: human clustering for meaning is always more effective than computational clustering. Try to come up with perhaps 8 to 10 domains that groups of cases might belong to. But also think of other ways of categorizing these cases or these decisions--by politics, by consequences on citizens (you could make a scale from 1 to 10), even an aggregated index of consequences/effects on different types of communities, sectors, regions, etc. \n",

Mr. Heytens. ORAL ARGUMENT OF TOBY J. HEYTENS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. HEYTENS: Mr. Chief Justice, and\\n\\nmay it please the Court: Fifteen years ago, Lee Malvo was tried, convicted, and sentenced for his role in the D.C. sniper attacks. Almost a decade later,\\n\\nMalvo sought federal habeas relief, relying exclusively on the new rule announced by this Court in Miller versus Alabama. But Miller\\'s rule does not cover Malvo\\'s case, and the lower courts erred in holding otherwise. I\\'d like to make three\\n\\npoints, one about Miller, one about Montgomery, and one about why this matters. First, if Miller\\'s holding isn\\'t concerned with mandatory sentences, much of this Court\\'s language in Miller makes very little sense. Miller repeatedly stated its own holding\\n\\nin terms of mandatory sentences, and the Court\\'s\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 4 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 minutes. So turning to the first point about Miller, I -- I think it\\'s just extremely hard, as Malvo\\'s brief now clarifies, that he only analysis specifically distinguished between mandatory and non-mandatory states. Second, Montgomery must be interpreted both in light of Miller and in light of the facts that were before the Court. All of the\\n\\ndefendants before the Court in both Miller and Montgomery had received mandatory sentences, and this Court should not lightly interpret a decision about retroactivity as having retroactively announced a new rule governing non-mandatory sentences. Finally, the reason why habeas is so formal and restrictive is because habeas is extraordinarily costly. Malvo\\'s victims were\\n\\nalready required to endure one full trial and sentencing hearing more than a decade ago, and the Court should not like -- lightly ask them to go through another, particularly given that the original sentencing fully complied with then controlling constitutional restrictions. I waive the remainder of my two\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 5 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 sought habeas relief based on Miller. And if\\n\\nyou look at Malvo\\'s original habeas petition -it\\'s on page 80, I believe, page 80 of the petition appendix -- he doesn\\'t just say that he\\'s seeking relief based on Miller; he says he\\'s seeking relief based on Miller\\'s holding that mandatory life without parole violates the Eighth Amendment. So I think even Malvo, when he originally sought habeas in this case, recognized the precise nature of Miller\\'s holding, and I think it\\'s extraordinarily hard to get away from that. JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Heytens, could\\n\\nwe back up a little and explain to me why these sentences are not mandatory? I mean, the jury\\n\\nhad only two choices, death or life without parole. And nobody seemed to have appreciated\\n\\nat the time of Malvo\\'s convictions that there was any discretion. And the -- and the piece of information I\\'d like to have, has any Virginia judge ever reduced a juvenile life without parole to life with parole or a term of years? MR. HEYTENS: Justice Ginsburg, I\\'m\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 not aware of any Virginia judge ever reducing a juvenile life without parole sentence for a person convicted of capital murder, which was the offense that Malvo is convicted of. I -- I\\n\\nbelieve that\\'s factually true, that I\\'m not aware of an example. There have been examples of Virginia courts considering whether to do so, although those long pre-date Malvo\\'s sentence -- I -- I acknowledge that those post-date Malvo\\'s sentence. To go to your question about what the jury was instructed, that is what the jury was instructed, but Virginia law is extremely clear that the sentencer is not the jury. sentencer is the judge. And under the Supreme Court of Virginia\\'s holding in Jones II, which Malvo does not and cannot challenge, this trial judge had the authority to suspend the sentence as a matter of state law and not only had the authority to do it but had the authority to do it at the time of Malvo\\'s trial. That\\'s the The\\n\\nspecific issue that the Supreme Court of Virginia addressed in Jones, and I think that\\'s\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 a binding holding as a matter of -JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But did the judge\\n\\nknow he could, given that there was no history of doing it? I think that\\'s -- that\\'s the\\n\\nposition of the SG in this case. But, more fundamentally, the Fourth Circuit concluded, I quote them, \"Malvo\\'s youth and attendant circumstances were not considered by either the jury or the judge to determine whether to sentence him to life without parole or some lesser sentence.\" Do you disagree with that statement? MR. HEYTENS: I think it\\'s very hard\\n\\nto tell, based on the record, whether they were. I think the fairest description of the record is that there is no affirmative indication one way or another. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: All right. So\\n\\ntell me what the practical effect is or why Montgomery and its language would have drawn a difference between a juvenile who was not sentenced to death because he was not incorrigible and a youth who, under a discretionary sentence, was sentenced not to death, to life without parole, even though the\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 judge didn\\'t think he was incorrigible but thought the crime was horrible. MR. HEYTENS: So -So that really is\\n\\nJUSTICE SOTOMAYOR:\\n\\nthe nub of this case, which, given the language of Montgomery and Miller, does it make any sense to treat either of them differently? MR. HEYTENS: So, Justice Sotomayor, I\\n\\nthink the first thing I\\'d say to that is I don\\'t think that, for Teague purposes, we can say given the language of Montgomery and Miller. I\\n\\nthink we need to be very specific where the rule that we\\'re talking about is coming from. And to address your question of what\\'s the difference, I think the difference is stated in the last paragraph of the Miller opinion, where the Court fundamentally identifies the problem with the scheme invalidated in Miller. The Court said that the sentencer was deprived of \"the opportunity to consider youth and its mitigating factors\" and instead that the states at issue in that case had required that all children receive life without parole sentences. As a matter of Virginia state law, that was not true here.\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: General, this is --\\n\\nmay be Justice Sotomayor\\'s question phrased a little bit differently. Of course, Miller talks\\n\\nabout mandatory schemes a lot because Miller was about a mandatory scheme, but do you think after Miller in a state where there was not a mandatory scheme, a judge could say, you know what, I just don\\'t feel like thinking about the defendant\\'s youth, I don\\'t think it\\'s remotely relevant, and I\\'m going to just sweep away anything that the defendant presents to me about that, I couldn\\'t care less? Do you think that that\\'s permissible under Miller? MR. HEYTENS: Justice Kagan, I\\'m\\n\\nsorry, I don\\'t think that would be permissible, but I think we need to distinguish between why that\\'s not permissible. I think, as a matter of\\n\\nthe Eighth Amendment, that\\'s not permissible. But I think that the articulation of the cases following Woodson and the death penalty illustrate why that is a new rule for Teague purposes. So I think that if a court were properly presented with that argument after\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Miller, it should hold that that\\'s an Eighth Amendment violation, but I think that would be a new rule for Teague purposes. And the way I know is how this played out in the capital context, right? So the Court\\n\\nfirst decides Woodson, which deals with a mandatory death penalty, very similar to Miller, and then the Court has a whole series of cases after Woodson, some of which really are very close to what you said, Justice Kagan, where the sentencer is not formally required to impose death but says I\\'m not going to consider youth. And the Court, in later cases, said that also violates the Eighth Amendment. JUSTICE KAGAN: MR. HEYTENS: But --\\n\\nBut there was no\\n\\nsuggestion that Woodson -JUSTICE KAGAN: I mean, it -- it -- I\\n\\nguess what you\\'re saying is that it would take another case to make that clear. Miller itself makes that clear. But I think If there\\'s\\n\\nanything that Miller says -- I mean, all of Miller, it\\'s a 30-page opinion and it can be summarized in two words, which is that youth matters and that you have to consider youth in\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 making these sorts of sentencing determinations. And, again, of course, it talks a lot about mandatory schemes because a mandatory scheme was in front of it, but the entire reasoning was about how much youth matters and how a judge or a jury, whoever the sentencer is, has to take that youth into account. That\\'s the lesson of Miller. MR. HEYTENS: that, Justice Kagan. First, I do want to differentiate because I think the habeas context matters here. I agree with you that, after Miller, the right interpretation of the Eighth Amendment is that the thing you describe would violate it. But I think under this Court\\'s Teague jurisprudence, that doesn\\'t resolve the question of whether decision II is a new rule. I mean, So two responses to\\n\\nthe Court has said ever since Teague that the definition of new rule is extraordinarily broad and includes anything that is not dictated by the earlier decision, and I just don\\'t see how one can read Miller and conclude that a decision that describes its holding in terms of mandatory sentences dictates that Virginia\\'s --\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 12 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 JUSTICE KAGAN: MR. HEYTEN: So --\\n\\n-- non-mandatory. -- I think I -- we\\'re\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:\\n\\njust going to posit that I disagree with that. MR. HEYTENS: Okay. But suppose I didn\\'t\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN: disagree with that.\\n\\nThen -- then you also have\\n\\nto deal with Montgomery because that\\'s the way Montgomery reads Miller. And Montgomery says\\n\\nthat\\'s what Miller said, it\\'s not some later new rule, that\\'s the rule for Miller, says Montgomery. MR. HEYTENS: And I certainly\\n\\nacknowledge that Montgomery says that, Justice Kagan, but I don\\'t think that\\'s controlling for Teague purposes and I think the Court has specifically actually confronted a case quite similar where that happened. The case, this is\\n\\ncited on page 17 of our brief, it\\'s Butler versus McKellar, where a very similar argument was made and rejected in the habeas context. So that case, the first case was Arizona -- was, excuse me, Edwards versus Arizona, the one that says that when the defendant says he wants to talk to a lawyer,\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: -- can I ask -I\\'m sorry, we police can\\'t go and talk to him without getting him a lawyer. And then seven years later, the Court in Arizona versus Roberson says that is true, even if the thing you want to go back and talk to him about is a different crime. And in\\n\\nRoberson, the Court said \"our decision is controlled by Arizona versus Edwards.\" And then, in Butler, in the habeas context, the Court said that was a new rule for Teague purposes. I just think that the argument\\n\\nthat Montgomery clarified or confirmed or any -any of the language that the Fourth Circuit -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: MR. HEYTENS: Can I --\\n\\n-- or the district court\\n\\ncouldn\\'t under Teague have made Miller retroactive, unless there was both a procedural and substantive rule. And so whether or not there are people who misread Miller or not, some courts did, lot didn\\'t, the substantive ruling of Miller was very clear, that it rendered life without -- I\\'m\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 14 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 quoting it, parole, an unconstitutional penalty for a class of defendants -- a class of defendants because of their status. That is\\n\\njuvenile offenders whose crime reflect the transient immaturity of youth. It announced --\\n\\nit says Miller announced a substantive rule of constitutional law. So it\\'s not a new procedural rule. It\\'s a new -- it is an old substantive law that it\\'s embodying. don\\'t see. Your case, the one you cited, was applying it not reading the old case, it was announcing a new take of that. Montgomery said That\\'s the distinction that I\\n\\nwe\\'re telling you what Montgomery -- what Miller said. MR. HEYTENS: Justice Sotomayor, I\\n\\ncertainly don\\'t disagree that there is language to that effect in Montgomery, but I think it is important that that language you just quoted is virtually all from Montgomery and appears nowhere in Miller except for a few words that are sort of included in that very long quote. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Suppose I try to\\n\\nread Miller and Montgomery together to figure\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 15 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 out what the substantive rule is and that I conclude the substantive rule is that the state cannot impose life without parole on youth who are merely immature but can impose it on those who are incorrigible. Okay? That\\'s -- suppose\\n\\nthat\\'s the substantive rule. I suppose Miller and Montgomery, then we have to figure out what the procedural rule attached to that was. MR. HEYTENS: Correct. The procedural\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:\\n\\nrule attached, you can read it in a couple different ways, so I want to get your thoughts, one is it rules out an on-the-record finding. Right? Montgomery says you don\\'t have to make a It\\'s explicit\\n\\nrecord finding of incorrigible. about that.\\n\\nThe question then for me comes down\\n\\nto is a discretionary sentencing regime alone enough to satisfy the procedural requirements to implement that substantive rule, or does there have to be something more on the record stated by the sentencing judge about youth? MR.

Now whether the court -The -- the \"that\"\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:\\n\\nbeing a discretionary sentencing issue? MR. HEYTENS: apologize. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: And why is it -I\\'m sorry. Yes, I\\n\\nwhy is something more procedurally not required? We know -- we know a record -- a finding of fact is explicitly ruled out by Montgomery and that\\'s very important. But why isn\\'t something more\\n\\nthan just a discretionary sentencing regime necessary? MR. HEYTENS: Well, I -- I think So\\n\\nparticularly because of the habeas context.\\n\\nI\\'m not -- I don\\'t want to rule out the notion that the Court couldn\\'t in the further elaboration of the Eighth Amendment require such a thing. But I think, in the habeas context,\\n\\nwhat\\'s critical is that this trial and sentence occurred long before either Montgomery or Miller, and the Court has emphasized that particularly in the habeas. I mean, Teague is not restrictive for the sake of being restrictive. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Let me ask it this\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 17 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 system. way. Do you think a discretionary sentencing\\n\\nregime is enough to satisfy the substantive Miller/Montgomery rule as I posit it that -that you can\\'t impose life without parole on someone who\\'s merely immature as opposed to incorrigible? MR. HEYTENS: I would say that under\\n\\nexisting law on collateral review, yes, I would. JUSTICE KAGAN: Even if you know for a\\n\\nfact that the sentencer did not take youth into account? MR. HEYTENS: guess first I would -JUSTICE KAGAN: It\\'s a discretionary Well, Justice Kagan, I\\n\\nThe sentencer could have taken youth But he didn\\'t. Well Justice Kagan, I\\n\\ninto account.\\n\\nMR. HEYTENS:\\n\\njust want to make sure this is a hypothetical or if you\\'re asking about the facts of this case. JUSTICE KAGAN: hypothetical. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: MR. HEYTENS: Okay. The hypothetical. I just want to No, no, is this the\\n\\nmake sure because my answer -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: I have a follow-up\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 18 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 -MR. HEYTENS: depending on -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: -- I -- I have a -- would be different\\n\\nfollow-up hypothetical to the hypothetical. MR. HEYTENS: Okay. So, if you know\\n\\n-- if you know for sure, say, because the sentencer specifically says on the record that they didn\\'t, I think for purposes of federal habeas review the answer is still that that is not a cognizable basis for retroactively invalidating a conviction. I think on direct review, I think that person would have a very strong argument. I\\n\\nsuspect that I would think that person\\'s going to have the better of the argument, that the person\\'s going to win, but that\\'s because the way the court\\'s cases develop is in a piecemeal fashion, and -- I\\'m sorry. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Okay. Now suppose\\n\\nthe record does not have what Justice Kagan posited, the record as it is in 99.99 percent of the cases is youth is raised by the defense counsel, and the sentencing judge either says nothing, just imposes the sentence without\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 19 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 enough? MR. HEYTENS: Yes. And the reason is explaining anything about youth, or just discusses youth but says ultimately still going to stick with life without parole. So, in that circumstance, is that\\n\\nbecause, as we explain in our brief -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: How do we know --\\n\\nand this is the tough part of the case for me, it\\'s right on this -- how do we know in that circumstance that the sentencing judge separated the incorrigible from the -- I\\'m using these phrases as shorthand -MR. HEYTENS: Sure. -- the mere -- the\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: merely immature? MR. HEYTENS:\\n\\nI think the best way we\\n\\nknow that is because, as our brief and the state\\'s brief explains, in every single state that has a discretionary sentencing scheme, the sentencer is specifically instructed to consider age, and I think the court particularly in the habeas context can presume that judges follow their obligation under state law.

MR. HEYTENS: Yes, the Supreme Court\\n\\nof Virginia in Jones II specifically articulates the factors that sentencers are supposed to consider including in deciding whether to suspend a sentence, and one of those factors is age. JUSTICE GINSBURG: If I understand -It specifies\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:\\n\\nin considering whether to suspend a sentence? MR. HEYTENS: I believe it does.

Mr. Feigin. ORAL ARGUMENT OF ERIC J. FEIGIN FOR THE UNITED STATES, AS AMICUS CURIAE, SUPPORTING THE PETITIONER MR. FEIGIN: Thank you, Mr. Chief were on the books at the time of this sentencing. It\\'s not like Virginia changed its\\n\\nlaw after its sentencing. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: unsure about that? What if we were\\n\\nShouldn\\'t we re -- even if\\n\\nyou are correct on the law here, isn\\'t there still a question of whether Virginia\\'s regime was truly discretionary? MR. HEYTENS: I don\\'t think there -Or do you think --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH: or do you think that\\'s over? MR. HEYTENS: Justice Kavanaugh.\\n\\nI -- I apologize,\\n\\nI think the Supreme Court of\\n\\nVirginia was very clear in Jones II about that. Thank you. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\\n\\nJustice, and may it please the Court: Malvo is arguing that his life without parole sentences for his murders are\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 22 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 retroactively invalid under Miller even if Virginia law allowed him to seek a lower sentence based on his age. That\\'s wrong for two reasons. First\\n\\nof all, the substantive retroactive holding of Miller is limited to mandatory sentences. Any\\n\\nobjection Malvo has to the particular sentencing proceedings in his individual case would at best fall under what Montgomery describes as Miller\\'s procedural component, which isn\\'t retroactive. Second, all that procedural component requires is the opportunity to raise age as a reason for a lower sentence. Neither Montgomery\\n\\nnor Miller prescribes a precise formula for taking age into account, let alone requires a sentencer to consider age even when a defendant himself fails to put it at issue. Now, Justice Kavanaugh, you asked how we know that a discretionary scheme -- the existence of a discretionary scheme is sufficient to protect against the substantive right that Montgomery finds that Miller recognizes. I think we know that from a couple of different places. First, in Miller itself, I\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 23 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 think the Court goes out of its way to compare and contrast discretionary schemes and mandatory schemes. I think you\\'ll find this in particular\\n\\nat page 484 of Miller, noting that, basically, as -- as I read Miller, discretionary schemes are generally getting it right and mandatory schemes aren\\'t. And I think it would be quite\\n\\nsurprising that the kind of scheme the Court used as its baseline for comparison turns out, in fact, to be unconstitutional. But the second place we know it I think is from page 734 of Montgomery, where the Court says that the ability -- and you combine that with page 735 that makes clear it\\'s the opportunity to consider age. That the\\n\\nprocedural component of Miller, which is the opportunity to consider age, is what protects the substantive right. And if, as the Fourth Circuit supposed and the Virginia Supreme Court held in Jones II, Malvo actually did have the opportunity to seek a lower sentence based on his age, then I don\\'t think he can recast his claim as a substantive claim under Miller that he had his substantive rights violated.\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 24 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: MR. FEIGIN: At --- his And his --\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: opportunity came from what? MR. FEIGIN:\\n\\nSo his opportunity came\\n\\nfrom the fact that the Virginia Supreme Court -again, Your Honor, we\\'re not taking a position on whether this should, in fact, be considered a mandatory or discretionary scheme under Miller. We are just assuming, along with the Fourth Circuit -- and I think, as Justice Kavanaugh\\'s recent questioning got at, we do think this should be remanded if the Court agrees with us for some further exploration of the nature of Virginia\\'s scheme. But assuming that this was a discretionary scheme, Jones II, the Virginia Supreme Court\\'s decision in that case, says that a defendant in Malvo\\'s position -- and Jones was, I think, similarly situated to Malvo in this respect -- was able to seek suspension of all or part of his sentence on any ground, including youth. And if that is correct and that is -and if that is sufficient for a scheme to be\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 25 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 Honor. considered discretionary under Miller, then I don\\'t think he has a claim under Miller. What\\n\\nhe might have, I suppose, is a very untimely ineffective assistance of counsel claim, although I\\'m not even sure he would succeed on the merits of that. But we don\\'t usually excuse\\n\\ndefendants from their failure to raise particular considerations and decide that their substantive rights have been violated for that reason. As Justice Kavanaugh noted, in 99.9 percent of these cases, youth is going to be raised, and that\\'s because everyone realizes that youth is important when you\\'re sentencing someone to life without parole. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: You -- you want us\\n\\nto hold that a discretionary regime satisfies Miller and Montgomery and remand for consideration of all these things, forfeiture, whether it was really discretionary? MR. FEIGIN: That\\'s correct, Your\\n\\nWe -- that\\'s our only submission in the\\n\\ncase, is that you should reverse the Fourth Circuit on its view that even if -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Right.\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 26 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 MR. FEIGIN: -- contrary to the\\n\\nVirginia Supreme Court\\'s view -- sorry, because even if, consistent with the Virginia Supreme Court\\'s view, this is a discretionary scheme, then he would have a Miller claim. JUSTICE KAGAN: But, again -- and this\\n\\nis the same question that I asked Mr. Heytens -if it\\'s a discretionary scheme, a judge could simply say, well, I don\\'t think that that consideration matters at all; I refuse to consider it. And you think that Miller does not\\n\\nhave anything to say about that? MR. FEIGIN: No, I think our answer to\\n\\nthat is a little bit different from General Heytens\\' answer. I do think Miller, as it\\'s\\n\\ncurrently written, and Montgomery would that say that a procedural right has been violated in that case. But what we have here is a question of retroactivity. And that\\'s a procedural -- what\\n\\nyou\\'re talking about is a procedural right that I think Miller does require at least the opportunity to consider age. And, given its\\n\\nanalogy to cases like Eddings against Oklahoma and Lockett against Ohio, I think the sentencer\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 27 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 can\\'t decide that legally youth has no weight. JUSTICE KAGAN: Right. So let\\'s --\\n\\nlet\\'s assume that, and, in fact, Miller says several times not just requires an opportunity to consider but requires consideration. And then what Montgomery does, as I understand it, is Montgomery makes clear that that procedural requirement is in service of a substantive requirement; in other words, the -it\\'s in service of a substantive rule, and that rule is the one that Justice Kavanaugh made reference to, which is the rule that the irretrievably corrupt, and only those people, can be subject to life in prison without parole. So the -- the -- the requirement of consideration is in service of the substantive rule that says, except for the irretrievably corrupt, you can\\'t sentence a juvenile to life without parole. MR. FEIGIN: So, Justice Kagan, let me\\n\\ngive you the sort of short answer to your question and then I have a slightly longer answer. I think the shorter answer to your\\n\\nquestion is yes, the procedural right protects a substantive one, but because it\\'s a procedural\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 28 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 right, it\\'s not retroactive. The only thing\\n\\nthat is retroactive under Montgomery is what Montgomery describes itself to be considering, and this is on page 732, is it says that what it\\'s considering is whether Miller\\'s holding that precludes mandatory sentences of life without parole for juvenile offenders is retroactive. JUSTICE KAGAN: No, Montgomery says\\n\\nMiller\\'s holding that only the irretrievably corrupt can be sentenced to life without parole. That\\'s what Montgomery says. And that\\'s -- you know, in fact, it\\'s taken language from Miller and saying that\\'s the substantive rule that comes out of Miller, which is this distinction between those who commit crimes based on transient immaturity, blah blah blah. MR. FEIGIN: So this gets at my\\n\\nsomewhat longer answer, Justice Kagan, which is that, you know, as we acknowledge in our brief, I think it\\'s very difficult to completely square some of the language in Montgomery with the language in Miller, which I think is very clearly focused on mandatory sentences.\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 29 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 way. going. MR. FEIGIN: The other thing I would And to the extent that the Court has to preference some language over other language, we\\'d urge the Court to preference the language that adheres to the common scenario in both cases which involved only mandatory sentences. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: MR. FEIGIN: The -Keep going. Keep Maybe I thought --\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:\\n\\nsay about the particular paragraph on which we\\'re focusing here is I think it makes more sense if you view Montgomery as really being focused on mandatory sentences, which is all anyone was thinking about in the case. And I think what Montgomery is trying to do in that paragraph is to fit Miller\\'s holding, which, again, Montgomery recognizes in several places is limited to mandatory sentences, into the language that this Court has used to describe substantive rules. And it does so in a kind of unique It describes the boundaries of the class\\n\\nof defendants who are benefitted under Miller using the procedural language of what a\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 30 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 sentencer who sentences under a discretionary scheme would necessarily need to find. The terms \"transient immaturity\" and \"irreparable corruption\" come from earlier cases like Roper and like Graham, where they\\'re used descriptively, not prescriptively, to describe the kind of judgment a sentencer necessarily makes in imposing this kind of sentence on a juvenile. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: MR. FEIGIN: But if it is --\\n\\nI don\\'t -That\\'s -- that\\'s just\\n\\nJUSTICE KAGAN:\\n\\nto say you wish Montgomery was a different opinion. It\\'s not a different opinion. It --\\n\\nit -- it creates the test that it creates based on the language in Miller, which, you\\'re right, was based on the language in Roper, so there\\'s a chain of decisions and -- but there\\'s a clear rule that comes out of it, which is this distinction between the irretrievably corrupt and all others. MR. FEIGIN: Well, Your Honor, I don\\'t\\n\\nthink it\\'s an especially clear rule, in part because it kind of -- if I may use the word fudges a little bit the way this Court\\'s\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 31 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: And that\\'s not -MR.

Usually, you describe a class\\n\\nby reference to some objective fact, like -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Well, the object\\n\\nobjective fact is the incorrigible. MR.

JUSTICE KAGAN: Those are the people\\n\\nwho can\\'t -- you cannot sentence in a certain kind of way. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: MR. FEIGIN: Right.\\n\\nWell, Your Honor, I\\n\\nthink, and Justice Kavanaugh was just getting at this, it\\'s not really an objective fact. It\\'s a\\n\\njudgment that someone\\'s going to have to make. As the Court -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: But that\\'s the\\n\\ncategory -- that\\'s -- I\\'m done.\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 32 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: JUSTICE GINSBURG: MR. FEIGIN: You can --\\n\\nMr. --\\n\\nI guess I\\'d just finish\\n\\nwith the thought that Montgomery\\'s framing of this I don\\'t think is particularly problematic if it\\'s limited to the only context anyone was considering in that case, mandatory sentences. But it becomes very problematic if the language is extended to invalidate all life without parole sentences under discretionary schemes. JUSTICE GINSBURG: Mr. Feigin, I would\\n\\nlike to ask you about the government\\'s change in position because, as I understood it, the government originally argued that juveniles -juveniles sentenced to life without parole must be resentenced after Miller and Montgomery, whether life without parole is mandatory or imposed as a matter of discretion. That was the position that the government took, and most of the lower courts are in accord with it. What led the -- to the\\n\\nSG\\'s change in position? MR. FEIGIN: Your Honor. Well, a couple things,\\n\\nFirst of all, as our brief notes,\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 33 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 counsel. MR. FEIGIN: Thank you. Ms. Spinelli. that wasn\\'t invariably our position. That was\\n\\nour position in the Mejia-Velez brief that Malvo cites, but in other briefs, we took a position that is more consistent with the one we are taking here. And to the extent that we have changed our position here, it\\'s because it\\'s very difficult, as I\\'ve acknowledged, to reconcile the language of Montgomery and Miller and it\\'s not something that we lightly ask lower courts to do as a matter of clarification. We try to\\n\\nfollow the letter of this Court\\'s decisions. I think this Court has frankly somewhat more leeway to kind of explain what it had in mind in Montgomery, which I think were only the discretionary sentences -- excuse me, mandatory sentences that were actually at issue in that case. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Thank you,\\n\\nCHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS:\\n\\nORAL ARGUMENT OF DANIELLE SPINELLI ON BEHALF OF THE RESPONDENT MS. SPINELLI: Mr. Chief Justice, and\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 34 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 case. may it please the Court: Miller and Montgomery control this The warden and the United States have\\n\\njust conceded that in order to rule for them, this Court would have to discard the reasoning of Montgomery. Miller held that before imposing life without parole on a juvenile a sentencer must consider how the characteristics of youth counsel against that sentence. That\\n\\nindividualized sentencing hearing, as Montgomery explained, effectuates the Eighth Amendment rule that life without parole is an excessive sentence for most juveniles, those who are not permanently incorrigible. Miller is not limited to mandatory schemes where life without parole is the only possible punishment. It invalidated those\\n\\nschemes because they guarantee that courts won\\'t consider whether youth warrants a lower sentence, which creates an unacceptable risk of excessive punishment, but when a court has the theoretical power to consider a lower sentence but doesn\\'t do so, which is what happened here, it creates precisely the same risk, as the\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 35 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 warden admits in his reply brief. And I\\'d like to correct some of the statements about what actually happened at the sentencing hearing here because this is -- this is important. Malvo was sentenced in 2004. That was\\n\\nnot only before Miller, it was before Roper. The prosecutor sought a death sentence for him. The issue before the jury was should he be sentenced to death or life without parole. That\\n\\nwas the only issue they were allowed to decide. At the sentencing hearing before the judge, which is extremely short, it\\'s eight pages at the end of the Joint Appendix, there was no consideration at all of imposing a sentence less than life without parole. And until a footnote in his reply brief, the warden hadn\\'t contested that. pretty hard to contest. The notion that, you know, somehow -somehow Miller was satisfied by, you know, the opportunity, the -- you know, the theoretical opportunity to consider youth, when it wasn\\'t actually considered, simply can\\'t be squared with the language of Miller itself or the It\\'s\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 36 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 language and reasoning of Montgomery. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: That argument\\n\\nyou\\'re making -- that argument you\\'re making is about the Virginia scheme, and we\\'ll get to that, I think, but there\\'s an initial question about what Miller and Montgomery mean. MS. SPINELLI: Mm-hmm. And you heard my\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:\\n\\nquestion about the substantive rule being something that separates the incorrigible from the merely immature. And the procedural rule\\n\\nparticularly articulated in Montgomery is you don\\'t need to make a finding of fact, a discretionary regime satisfies it. And my question to you is why isn\\'t a discretionary regime -- and I know you disagree that Virginia is such a thing, but we\\'ll put that aside for the moment -- why isn\\'t a discretionary sentencing regime enough procedurally to satisfy the substantive rule articulated in Miller and Montgomery? MS. SPINELLI: Because the substantive\\n\\nrule, which I think you -- I agree with your articulation, the substantive rule requires that in order to ensure that juveniles don\\'t receive\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 37 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 an unconstitutionally disproportionate punishment, a court must consider the characteristics of youth and must make a determination as to whether that juvenile -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: I\\'m sorry to -MS.

So --\\n\\n-- for the individual\\n\\nBut, in most sentencing regimes, as you well know, throughout the country in the variety of sentencing courts, judges are required to consider all sorts of factors by state law. In arguments are raised to the state\\n\\ncourt judge, the trial judge, about all sorts of factors. The judge will often impose sentence without marching through a checklist of all those factors. Yet, it is routinely accepted\\n\\nthat the judge has \"considered the factor\" if it has been raised or even if it\\'s required as a\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 39 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 matter of state law. There are lots of state\\n\\ncases and federal cases that say, so long as the issue\\'s been raised, we assume the judge \"considered it.\" Now, if that\\'s true, and you can disagree with that, but if that\\'s true, doesn\\'t a discretionary regime where the argument can be raised necessarily satisfy Miller and Montgomery\\'s requirement of consideration? MS. SPINELLI: me explain why. No, it doesn\\'t, and let\\n\\nIn this particular case, it\\n\\ndoesn\\'t because this was decided not -- this -he was sentenced not only before Miller but before Roper.

And, Do you agree\\n\\nJUSTICE KAVANAUGH:\\n\\ntherefore, can\\'t you presume, and don\\'t we do this, as Justice Sotomayor was indicating, I\\'m not putting words in her mouth, but in 3553-A cases, we also presume when something\\'s been argued to the sentencing judge that the judge has \"considered\" that factor.

But the court also said we\\n\\nrequire a sentencer to take into account how children are different. And the reason that it\\n\\nrequires that is in order to effectuate the Eighth Amendment prohibition on disproportionate sentences for juveniles. JUSTICE GORSUCH: Counsel, if -- if\\n\\nthere were a requirement of a finding -- a substantive right to a finding of incorrigibility before the -- the sentence of life without parole were permissible under the Eighth Amendment, wouldn\\'t it follow also that there\\'s a Sixth Amendment right under Apprendi to have a jury decide that rather than a judge?

MS. SPINELLI: Well, that -- that\\n\\nissue was not resolved in Miller or Montgomery, and I don\\'t think it needs to be resolved today. JUSTICE GORSUCH: Isn\\'t that -- isn\\'t\\n\\nthat a further strike, though, against your interpretation of Miller and Montgomery that the Court would have created a new substantive right that implicates the Sixth Amendment and not ever said so or even hinted at it or even acknowledged the question?

MS. SPINELLI: with Atkins. That is what happened\\n\\nAtkins is very similar to this\\n\\ncase in that it barred the imposition of the death penalty on the intellectually disabled. As in this case, there needs to be a procedure to sort out the intellectually disabled from those who are not.

CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: Montgomery? From know -MS. SPINELLI: defendant. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: -- we know it -- for that particular have said no, it doesn\\'t have to be made by a jury. It -- it can be made by a judge. And\\n\\nstates have allocated that determination in different ways. So it\\'s not at all unusual that the court wouldn\\'t have addressed the Apprendi issue in these decisions, but, I mean, to return to Justice Kavanaugh\\'s question about procedure and substance, the two necessarily go together. The -- the necessary procedure has to effectuate the substantive rule. And,\\n\\ntherefore, as Montgomery says, it has to -- it has to involve a determination as to whether life without parole will be a proportionate sentence -CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: But -- but we\\n\\ndoesn\\'t require a formal finding, right? MS. SPINELLI: That -- that -- that is\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 54 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 MS. SPINELLI: It doesn\\'t require --\\n\\nit doesn\\'t require any particular form of words. It does require a substantive result. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: said it requires a determination. that sounds like a formal finding. But -- but you And to me, And one\\n\\nthing we do know is that a formal finding is not required. So it would seem that consideration -and I thought we had gotten that far before -sort of it being included with respect to factors that must be considered in imposing a sentence. We\\'re talking about 3553, which has a\\n\\nlist of things that have to be considered, and this would be -- be one of them. MS. SPINELLI: Yes. And, again, we --\\n\\nyou know, we\\'re not presented here with a question of what exactly a fact finder would have to say. CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS: because I -- because I asked it. (Laughter.) MS. SPINELLI: I\\'m sorry, Your Honor. Well, you are,\\n\\nI apologize, Mr. Chief Justice. What I -- what I meant is, you know,\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 55 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 that is -- that is going to be an issue no matter how the Court decides this case. There\\n\\nhave already been 2,000 resentencings under Miller at which courts have made an effort to apply the Miller factors. There is -- Montgomery did not specify a turn of phrase or a specific finding that has to be made, but what\\'s absolutely clear is that the Court does have to decide whether, in light of the characteristics of youth, this is a proportionate -- life without parole is a proportionate sentence for this particular defendant. JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: think Montgomery -MS. SPINELLI: come close -JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: Montgomery says decide. -- I don\\'t think -- and that didn\\'t even I don\\'t -- I don\\'t\\n\\nI mean, decide, to pick\\n\\nup on the Chief Justice\\'s question, sounds like determination, sounds like finding.

SPINELLI: Correct, it just says\\n\\nfinding of fact.\\n\\nBut it then says that Miller\\n\\ndid not impose a formal fact-finding requirement, doesn\\'t leave states free to sentence a child whose crime reflects transient immaturity to life without parole. So Montgomery doesn\\'t provide a lot of guidance, but what we do know is that juveniles are entitled to at least one opportunity to show that they are not permanently incorrigible and that it is not right to make a determination now that they are foreclosed from ever attempting to show that they have changed.\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 57 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 JUSTICE KAVANAUGH: And your argument\\n\\nthat Virginia did not provide that is?

Let\\'s say that\\'s the state of the law in Virginia hypothetically. Now we don\\'t --\\n\\nmaybe we don\\'t know that, but let\\'s just assume that, that all arguments are available, not just incorrigibility, any arguments about youth are available, even better for the defendant, all of it has to be considered.

In fact, you know, he had no way of anticipating that -- that this new constitutional rule would be announced. The\\n\\nCourt hadn\\'t even taken the first step down the road toward that. So, you know, even if it were the case that he absolutely could have gotten the same consideration had he, you know, been able to look into the future, that is not what we typically require defendants to do. And that\\'s\\n\\nwhy the Miller rule is retroactive in the first place.

JUSTICE GORSUCH: MS. SPINELLI: Okay. I -- I am -- I We\\'re and the -- and the district judge has to consider them. Would that, in your mind,\\n\\nsatisfy Miller and Montgomery? MS. SPINELLI: It -- it might very\\n\\nYeah.\\n\\n-- I am not arguing that it would not.\\n\\nonly talking about the situation here, where there was no consideration of youth, not only with Malvo, but all 13 of the people who are serving juvenile life without parole for capital murder in Virginia were sentenced in exactly the same way. In none of those cases was there any meaningful consideration of a lower sentence, let alone consideration of whether youth made life without parole unconstitutional. In the only two cases where defense counsel raised the possibility of a lower sentence, the prosecutor said absolutely not, life without parole is the mandatory minimum sentence. So we know that -- and -- and we know and the Fourth Circuit made a finding and the\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 64 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 district court made a finding to this effect, that youth was not considered in the way Miller requires. And -JUSTICE ALITO: In what way was it\\n\\nnecessary for the -- the youth of your client to be considered? Do you think -- you describe him\\n\\nas a child who committed these crimes because of transient immaturity? MS. SPINELLI: I -- I have not\\n\\ndescribed him as a child who committed these crimes because of transient immaturity. JUSTICE ALITO: Well, I thought that\\n\\nwas the test that you\\'re saying that the court has to apply, whether that -- whether it is a child who committed the crimes because of transient immaturity. MS. SPINELLI: The question is whether\\n\\nthe juvenile committed the crimes based on transient immaturity or permanent incorrigibility. And what we are asking for is\\n\\na hearing in Virginia court where the Virginia sentencer will make that determination. He has not had that hearing yet, the hearing that Miller and Montgomery require. And\\n\\nhe is entitled to have one opportunity to make\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 65 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 not. the case that he is not permanently incorrigible. JUSTICE ALITO: at the time? MS. SPINELLI: hypothesis -JUSTICE ALITO: sentencing? MS. SPINELLI: -- this is -- you know, At the time of the Well, I think by Is not now or was not\\n\\nif one is permanently incorrigible, that\\'s a permanent quality. So it certainly is relevant\\n\\non resentencing what someone has done since they committed the crime. They may well have, you\\n\\nknow, been able to provide evidence based on what they did after the crime, that they are not, in fact, permanently incorrigible. JUSTICE ALITO: So, if he can\\n\\ndemonstrate, as a result of good behavior in prison, for example, that he has been rehabilitated, then he must be released? MS. SPINELLI: No. No, absolutely\\n\\nThat\\'s one piece of evidence that the The sentencer then can\\n\\nsentencer can consider.\\n\\ndecide what is the sentence going to be. And, you know, on resentencing, there\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 66 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 counsel. MS. SPINELLI: Thank you. General are occasions when juvenile offenders are resentenced to life without parole. Even if he\\n\\nwere given parole eligibility, that would not mean that he would be released. It would mean that he would have the opportunity sometime in the future to make the case to a parole board that he has changed. So\\n\\nwe are -- we are nowhere near any prospect of being released. So, I mean, the Court -- the warden and the United States have made it extremely clear that they are asking this Court to discard the reasoning of Montgomery. And there\\'s\\n\\nabsolutely no reason for the Court to do that. All of the arguments that they\\'ve raised were also raised in Montgomery, and the Court declined to adopt them, and it shouldn\\'t change here.

HEYTENS ON BEHALF OF THE PETITIONER MR. HEYTENS: address three points: So I\\'d just like to what Miller requires, the\\n\\nshifting nature of Malvo\\'s arguments, and why this matters. So I think Miller is quite clear what it requires because it\\'s in the very last paragraph of Miller. The Court says on page\\n\\n489, \"The judge or jury must have the opportunity to consider mitigating evidence.\" And, Mr. Chief Justice, you asked how do I know he had that opportunity? I can report\\n\\nVirginia code 19.2, 264.4, which is in the red appendix at 3, says he had that opportunity. And the Virginia Supreme Court\\'s decision in Jones says it at 795 S.E.2d at 722. They\\n\\nspecifically say, \"Nor are we aware of any case in which a sentencing statute gave the juvenile offender the opportunity to present mitigating evidence but the sentencing court arbitrarily refused to consider it. If there were such a\\n\\ncase, we would not need the Eighth Amendment because that would be reversed as a matter of\" --\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 68 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: And how about the\\n\\ncase they cited where counsel did raise this argument about the youth and the judge said, I have no power? MR. HEYTENS: I think that would be --\\n\\nfirst of all, that\\'s not this case, because there was no such objection. JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR: But -- but it does\\n\\nprovide some evidence that -- and that plus the history that before Jones, there was no juvenile convicted of life without parole who was ever -whose sentence was ever suspended. MR. HEYTENS: But -- but I think at\\n\\nmost, under Jones, that establishes that that individual was sentenced in violation of state law, not in violation of the Eighth Amendment, and that\\'s not Mr. Malvo. Mr. Malvo never requested such an opportunity. And had he requested such an\\n\\nopportunity, he could have pursued -- sorry, if he requested that opportunity and the trial court refused to do it, he could then have appealed to the very same court that decided Jones II and said the language that I just quoted. If I --\\n\\nHeritage Reporting Corporation\\n\\n\\x0cOfficial 69 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 JUSTICE BREYER: The practical -- the\\n\\npractical reading that I would give of these cases, possibly, first case, you cannot sentence under state law that\\'s mandatory a -- a juvenile to life without parole. Why not? Because\\n\\nnobody\\'s really considered whether he\\'s immature. So it\\'s the reasoning, it\\'s not this That\\'s the reasoning.\\n\\nprocedural.\\n\\nThis case, they sentence him to life without parole. And the odds are greater than\\n\\n50/50 that no one ever thought about whether he was, in fact, immature. me like the same case. Now, leaving all these words out of it, why isn\\'t it the same case? I mean, I know Okay? Now it sounds to\\n\\nwords like opportunity, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah, but isn\\'t there enough to say the odds are better than 50/50 -MR.

Look for words or phrases that uniquely repeat at the beginning and at the end of the arguments. The easiest way to isolate this, to do a simple split() on one of those phrases, and keep the half of The split you want.
